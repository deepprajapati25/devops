### Theory
#### Principle of devops
DevOps is a set of principles and practices that emphasize collaboration, automation, and integration between development and IT operations teams to enable faster and more reliable software delivery.

#### Practises of Devops
DevOps practices include continuous integration, continuous delivery, automated testing, infrastructure as code, and collaboration between development and operations teams.

#### Devops engineer roles and responsibilites 
DevOps engineers automate and streamline software development and deployment processes, manage infrastructure as code, implement CI/CD pipelines, monitor and troubleshoot systems, and collaborate with development and operations teams to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

#### What is Jenkins 
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, deploying, and automating software development and integration processes, particularly in the context of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

#### make it more simple

Jenkins is a tool that helps automate the process of building and deploying software, making it easier and more efficient.

#### what is pipelining in Devops

In DevOps, pipelining refers to creating a series of automated steps, called a pipeline, to streamline and manage the software delivery process, from development to deployment, often using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.

#### pros and cons of Pipeline
Pros of pipelines in DevOps: Automation, consistency, faster software delivery, easier collaboration.
Cons: Complex to set up initially, maintenance overhead, potential for bottlenecks.

#### What is Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which are lightweight, isolated environments that package everything needed to run the application, including code, dependencies, and configurations.

#### What is Nagios
Nagios is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that helps IT teams track the health and performance of their IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, and services, by sending alerts when issues are detected.

#### What are Puppet Tools
Puppet is an automation tool that helps manage and configure IT infrastructure by defining infrastructure as code. Puppet offers several tools and components, including Puppet Enterprise, Puppet Bolt, Puppet Forge, and PuppetDB, for configuration management, task automation, and reporting.

#### smaller varaiant
Puppet tools include Puppet Enterprise, Puppet Bolt, Puppet Forge, and PuppetDB for automating and managing IT infrastructure.

#### Pros and cons of jenkins
Pros of Jenkins: Open-source, extensible, robust CI/CD, large community.
Cons: Configuration complexity, resource-intensive, can have a learning curve.

#### Where can we use Nagios in Devops
Nagios can be used in DevOps for monitoring and alerting in various aspects of IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, applications, and services, helping to ensure reliability and availability.

#### Basic difference in Devops and Advance Devops
There is no strict division between "basic" and "advanced" DevOps, but advanced DevOps typically involves more sophisticated automation, infrastructure as code, extensive use of microservices, and a deeper integration of security and compliance into the DevOps processes.

#### Simpler one difference
Basic DevOps focuses on core principles like automation and collaboration, while advanced DevOps involves more complex tools and practices like extensive automation, microservices, and security integration.
