## 7C's of DevOps
 everything is continuous in DevOps — from planning to monitoring. So let’s break down the entire lifecycle into seven phases where continuity is at its core. Any phase in the lifecycle can iterate throughout the project multiple times until it’s finished.

1. Continuous development

2. Continuous integration

3. Continuous testing

4. Continuous deployment

5. Continuous feedback

6. Continuous monitoring

7. Continuous operations

### Jenkins in detail
This tool is free of cost. <br/>
It is easy to install. <br/>
Jenkins has 1000+ plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does not exist for your requirement, you can code it and share with the community. <br/>
It doesn’t require additional installations or components. Means it is easy to install.<br/>
Jenkins is built with Java and hence, it is portable to all the major platforms.<br/>
It can execute bash scripts, shell scripts, ANT and Maven Targets.<br/>
Developers write the tests to detect the errors of their code as soon as possible. So the developers don’t waste time on large-scale error-ridden integrations.<br/>
It also provides support for scheduled builds & automation test execution.<br/>
Jenkins Disadvantages<br/>
Jenkins interface is out dated and not user friendly compared to current UI trends.<br/>
The larger problem is that majority of the Jenkins’ plugins are coded by third party. So, the quality of these coded may differ. And these may not assure steadiness.<br/>
Continuous integrations regularly break due to some small setting changes. Continuous integration will be paused and therefore requires some developer attention.<br/>
Not easy to maintain it because it runs on a server and requires some skills as server administrator to monitor its activity.

### Nagios in detail
Nagios is a powerful monitoring system that enables organizations to identify and resolve IT infrastructure problems before affecting critical business processes. <br/>

Like some of the most popular and useful platforms & tools in the DevOps ecosystem, Nagios is open-source. It was originally designed to run on the Linux operating system but now functions on Linux, Windows, as well as Unix operating systems.<br/>

One of the most important things Nagios does is that it runs periodic checks on critical parameters of application, network, and server resources. Nagios will monitor important parameters and functions like memory usage, disk usage, microprocessor load, number of processes running simultaneously at any given time, log files that are running, etc. It will also monitor important services, including common network protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP 3 (Post Office Protocol 3), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), etc. Nagios will initiate active checks regularly. The passive checks would be done by the external applications which are connected to Nagios.

### Theory
#### Principle of devops
DevOps is a set of principles and practices that emphasize collaboration, automation, and integration between development and IT operations teams to enable faster and more reliable software delivery.

#### Practises of Devops
DevOps practices include continuous integration, continuous delivery, automated testing, infrastructure as code, and collaboration between development and operations teams.

#### Devops engineer roles and responsibilites 
DevOps engineers automate and streamline software development and deployment processes, manage infrastructure as code, implement CI/CD pipelines, monitor and troubleshoot systems, and collaborate with development and operations teams to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

#### What is Jenkins 
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, deploying, and automating software development and integration processes, particularly in the context of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

#### make it more simple

Jenkins is a tool that helps automate the process of building and deploying software, making it easier and more efficient.

#### what is pipelining in Devops

In DevOps, pipelining refers to creating a series of automated steps, called a pipeline, to streamline and manage the software delivery process, from development to deployment, often using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.

#### pros and cons of Pipeline
Pros of pipelines in DevOps: Automation, consistency, faster software delivery, easier collaboration.
Cons: Complex to set up initially, maintenance overhead, potential for bottlenecks.

#### What is Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, which are lightweight, isolated environments that package everything needed to run the application, including code, dependencies, and configurations.<br/>
Using Docker with DevOps makes it easier to create applications using unique interconnected components. You also get a high level of control over all the changes during the development life cycle. This makes it easier to go back to a previous version of the application you want.

#### What is Nagios
Nagios is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that helps IT teams track the health and performance of their IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, and services, by sending alerts when issues are detected.

#### What are Puppet Tools
Puppet is an automation tool that helps manage and configure IT infrastructure by defining infrastructure as code. Puppet offers several tools and components, including Puppet Enterprise, Puppet Bolt, Puppet Forge, and PuppetDB, for configuration management, task automation, and reporting.

#### smaller varaiant
Puppet tools include Puppet Enterprise, Puppet Bolt, Puppet Forge, and PuppetDB for automating and managing IT infrastructure.

#### What is jenkins
Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation platform with plugins designed for continuous integration. It is used to continually create and test software projects, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to integrate changes to the project and for consumers to get a new build.

#### Pros and cons of jenkins
Pros of Jenkins: Open-source, extensible, robust CI/CD, large community.
Cons: Configuration complexity, resource-intensive, can have a learning curve.

#### Where can we use Nagios in Devops
Nagios can be used in DevOps for monitoring and alerting in various aspects of IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, applications, and services, helping to ensure reliability and availability.

#### Basic difference in Devops and Advance Devops
There is no strict division between "basic" and "advanced" DevOps, but advanced DevOps typically involves more sophisticated automation, infrastructure as code, extensive use of microservices, and a deeper integration of security and compliance into the DevOps processes.

#### Simpler one difference
Basic DevOps focuses on core principles like automation and collaboration, while advanced DevOps involves more complex tools and practices like extensive automation, microservices, and security integration.
